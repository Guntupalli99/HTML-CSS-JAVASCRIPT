<b>Tea</b> is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, 
an evergreen shrub native to China and other East Asian countries.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[4] 
<p>There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[5] while others have vastly different 
profiles that
 include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.[6]</p>

 <h1>Etymology</h1>
 <p>The etymology of the various words for tea reflects the history of transmission of tea drinking culture and trade from China to countries around the world.[12] Nearly all of the words for tea worldwide fall into three broad groups: te, cha and chai, present in English as tea, cha or char, and chai. The earliest of the three to enter English is cha, which came in the 1590s via the Portuguese, who traded in Macao and picked up the Cantonese pronunciation of the word.[13][14] The more common tea form arrived in the 17th century via the Dutch, who acquired it either indirectly from the Malay teh, or directly from the tÃª pronunciation in Min Chinese.[13] The third form chai (meaning "spiced tea") originated 
     from a northern Chinese pronunciation of cha, which travelled overland to Central Asia and Persia where it picked up a Persian ending yi.</p>
