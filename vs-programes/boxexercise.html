    <p>Hampi is an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka. It’s dotted with numerous ruined
        temple complexes from the Vijayanagara Empire. On the south bank of the River Tungabhadra is the 7th-century
        Hindu Virupaksha Temple, near the revived Hampi Bazaar. A carved stone
        chariot stands in front of the huge Vittala Temple site. Southeast of Hampi, Daroji Bear Sanctuary is home
        to the Indian sloth bear. ― Google
