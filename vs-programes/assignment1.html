        <p style="right;"><b>Tetley is a beverage manufacturer founded in
                1837 in Yorkshire,England.[1] It is the largest tea company in the United Kingdom and Canada, and
                the
                second largest
                in the United States by volume.
                Since 2000, Tetley has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Consumer Products (formerly Tata
                Global
                Beverages),
                headquartered in Kolkata, making it the second largest manufacturer of teas in the world, after
                Unilever.[2][3]
                n 1822, brothers Joseph and Edward Tetley sold salt from a pack horse in Huddersfield, Yorkshire,
                England.
                They started to sell tea and were so successful they set up as "Joseph Tetley & Co."
                tea merchants in 1837.[4] Relocating to London in 1856, they formed "Joseph Tetley & Company,
                Wholesale
                Tea
                Dealers",
                in partnership with Joseph Ackland.[5].In 1952,in an early example of cross promotion, Petula
                Clark's
                single
                "Anytime Is Tea Time Now" was used to advertise Tetley on Radio Luxembourg. Tetley was the first
                company
                to
                sell tea
                in tea-bags in the United Kingdom in 1953.[6] In 1989, following extensive consumer tests
                establishing
                Britons' preferences,
                Tetley launched the round tea bag.[7]
